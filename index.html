          <h2>About</h2>
          <p> Recently, I have finished my studies at Liverpool of University with an expected <b>2:1 in Mechatronics and
            Robotic systems (BEng)</b>  and now progressed onto a postgraduate degree in Computer science. In 2017 I
            completed an HNC in Mechatronics (Distinction) and was gratefully awarded Engineering Student of the year. I
            consider myself to be hardworking, loyal, polite and kind guy with a strong work ethic, easy-going and enjoy
            working in a team or on my own initiative. Through my BTEC studies in electrical engineering I was also
            gratefully awarded 3 awards, including the Jaap Krose Scholarship which can be seen on the college twitter
            account <a href="https://twitter.com/hartlepoolfe/status/667438332557860865">@hartelpoolfe</a>.</p>
          <p>My spare time tends to focus on learning new skills and reading up on different topics, gaming, and
            physical fitness. In my personal time I developed an interest investing into the stock market and learning
            about blockchain cryptocurrency technology. </p>

<!-- *********************CAREER GOAL SECTION**************************-->
  <div class="wrapped-row-2">
      <article class="longText" id="CareerGoal">
        <h2>Career Goal</h2>
        <p>
          I plan to pursue a career in the computer science industry with the help from my undergraduate
          degree in engineering, I hope to use the two to help solve theoretical and practical approaches to
          computational tasks. My goal is to finish my postgraduate degree and pursue a career in a workplace involving developing software solutions to new and upcoming technology and use my skills learnt from engineering to help solve problematic solutions involving algorithm and mathematical problems.Through my undergraduate degree my final year project involved creating a wireless Bluetooth low energy mesh networking system to help monitor vulnerable people living alone at home. The project was written in C++ and involved finding unique solutions to certain situations, the system also had to be cheap and it was best to use older devices to save on money. These cheaper devices had memory constraints, so the system had to consider memory usage, power consumption and security.</p> <p>I hope to eventually work on new and innovative technology and head towards working closely with a financial firm which would be focusing on new technology implementations like blockchain technology. I have a strong interest in working in a financial technology company(<em>FinTech</em>) where I can use skills my degree and work on ideas i'm personally interested in. I have a keen interest in the stock market and analysing financial data and charts, and in my personal time he tends to focus on the stock market and cryptocurrency.
